Good evening,

Some of this night's Karneblocket reminders failed to be delivered.
The official excuses are given below:

<% @failures.each_with_index do |(listing, error), index| %>
  (<%= index + 1%>) Reminder to <%= listing.seller.email %> fails to deliver.
    due to <%= error.class %> (<%= error.message %>)
<% end %>

You'll probably hear from me again tomorrow unless you correct the
error manually. Please direct any questions or insults to johan@forberg.se.

Regards.
